# Fake News Detection Using BERT

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Transformer-based model (BERT). The system classifies news text as Real or Fake based on its content.

## Objective
- Detect fake news automatically
- Apply NLP and machine learning techniques
- Build a simple and practical ML project

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BERT (Transformer model)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## Dataset
A publicly available fake news dataset containing labeled news articles as Real or Fake.

## Workflow
1. Data collection and cleaning
2. Text preprocessing
3. Tokenization using BERT tokenizer
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Fake news prediction

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Result
The BERT-based model performs better than traditional machine learning models by understanding the context of news text.
